Note: After, you've done instruction you should add your ip or domain name(if you have it), on the search bar of the web browser.
In my case this is FireFox Browser. If it didn't work,and you didn't get any output,here are commands to find the problem.

1) sudo apachectl configtest (If it gives "Syntax is Ok" and again the same issue,try other steps)
2)sudo tail -n 2 /var/log/apache2/error.log (Log files  which is incredibly useful for troubleshooting any issue)
3) sudo systemctl status apache2 (checking if apache2 is active)
4)sudo systemctl restart apache2 (restarting apache2)
Then, check the status again.

Output for apache2(systemctl status apache2):
