•ls -ltr  (listing all files)
•unzip latest.zip (unzipping latest.zip)
•mv nextcloud nextcloud.linux.cloud (in my case,I changed file name but for default it should be just "nextcloud"")
•sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud.linux(File Name).cloud
•sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf (it will shut down default page of apache,for nextcloud page showing up)

Note: Host Configuration file for Nextcloud is one of the most essential parts creating nextcloud, one small mistake can lead to different problems in apache2.
Including Nexxtcloud requires minimum PHP 7.4
•sudo nano /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini (php version depends on your ubuntu/kubuntu/redhat etc. systems,you can check your machine version using this command "cat /etc/os-release")

Note: PHP config changes including further information is inside PHP file.
